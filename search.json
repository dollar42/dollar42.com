In a simple format, what funds are in my IRA, my spouse’s 401(k), our HSA, a taxable account, etc.?\nWhat is my actual asset allocation spanning all of my accounts?1\nHow does my actual asset allocation compare to my target (desired) allocation?\n\nAnd how do I fix things if actual diverges too much from target?\nThe spreadsheet does not need much information. For Alice and Bob’s example portfolio in this post, I have entered:\n\nAccount names and types.\nFund symbols and the asset class(es) they represent.\nHoldings/transactions: a fund and the number of shares owned per account (e.g., Roth IRA, 936 shares of VTI2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransactions\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this data filled in, the next tab called Account Holdings automatically generates a report.\nThe spreadsheet uses the GOOGLEFINANCE function to dynamically recalculate current values as share prices change over time:\n\n\n\nAccount Holdings\n\n\nI use this report to cross-check against my online statements. If any value is too different, I probably missed entering a transaction into the spreadsheet.\nI also print this report to include with my estate plan.

The allocations to all other asset classes are also automatically adjusted downward slightly to account for the cash buffer.\nA cash buffer is optional, but I find it important to support in a simple way.\nThe variable names and values on the right are both editable.

    "section": "Rebalance Matrix",
    "text": "Rebalance Matrix\nWith the target asset allocation in place, the next tab called Rebalance Matrix generates a report.\n\n\n\nRebalance Matrix\n\n\nThis report places accounts vertically on the left and asset classes horizontally across the top.\nEach cell in the inner matrix pairs a fund with account and asset class.\nIn cell B12, $257,250 of VTI (a US stock fund) is owned in the Roth IRA (Alice) account and is in the US Stocks asset class. It is the only fund owned in that account.\nIn cell C14, $310,500 of VXUS (an international stock fund) is owned in the Roth IRA (Bob) account and is in the Int’l Stocks asset class. Similarly, it is the only fund owned in its account.\nDifferent funds in the same asset class are “stacked” vertically. Cells B20-B23 show 65% of VT and 100% of VTI allocated to US Stocks within the Brokerage (Joint) account. 35% of VT, its non-US allocation, is shown in cell C20 under the Int’l Stocks asset class. In total, the Brokerage (Joint) account owns VT, VTI, SCHP and VMFXX.\nLooking back toward the top in rows 4-10, Target (% and $) and Actual show target and actual asset class allocations in percent and dollars, summed by column, representing the allocations summed across all accounts.\nIf target and actual deviate too far, the Difference cells will automatically become more red, indicating that money should ideally start moving from well-performing asset classes to relatively underperforming ones (“sell high, buy low!”).\nAlice and Bob probably do not need to rebalance in this example. They are within 1 percentage point of their desired asset allocation in every asset class (row 7). The largest deviation is shown in cell D7 and D10 but is small compared to their portfolio.\n\nA Different Scenario\nIf I were Alice and Bob, I would open the spreadsheet every few months to add new transactions and check for growing deviations in the Rebalance Matrix. Close monitoring would not be required.\nBut what if Alice and Bob want to experiment with raising their stock allocation to 75% (from 65%)? In the Asset Allocation sheet:\n\n\n\nChanging the stock allocation to 75%\n\n\nThe Rebalance Matrix sheet automatically regenerates5:\n\n\n\nRebalance Matrix with 75% target stock allocation\n\n\nThe story here is much more, er, red.\nAs expected, Alice and Bob would need to start moving money out of Nom. Bonds and TIPS and into US Stocks and Int’l Stocks.\nFor example, US stocks are now 5.24 percentage points (cell B7) from target. $114,579 (cell B10) needs to flow from other asset classes into US Stocks to rebalance exactly.\nRebalancing can be a complicated exercise involving personalized circumstances and tax considerations. The spreadsheet lets me quickly experiment with several ideas before executing any trades.\nFor this example, I will show one possible transaction in what might need to be multiple to fully complete the rebalance:\n\n\n\nA trial rebalance in the Transactions sheet\n\n\nThese rows represent an exchange Alice could consider to rebalance from Nom. Bonds and into US Stocks in her Example Corp 401(k):\n\nA sale (negative shares) of -11,068.335 shares of FXNAX, a fund in the Nom. Bonds category that is currently overweight by $133,486 (cell D10).\nWith the proceeds, a purchase (positive shares) of $115,000 of FSKAX, a US stock fund. $115,000 is a rounded off version of the $114,579 inflow (cell B10) needed to reach the target allocation of US Stocks.\n\nI used =115000 / GOOGLEFINANCE(\"SYMBOL\") to get the rough number of shares for $115,000 of each fund at today’s prices. For the sale, I used -115000, a negative number.\nIf Alice actually executed this transaction, she would later change the values to the exact share counts when the trade settled.\nAdding these two transactions causes the Rebalance Matrix to automatically regenerate:\n\n\n\nRebalance Matrix after the exchange\n\n\nIn cells B16-D17, the exchange is shown as $115,000 of newly purchased FSKAX (the stock fund) while FXNAX (the bond fund) shows a balance reduced by $115,000 compared to the prior screenshot. Total balances have not changed because money is only moving from one fund to another, netting to zero.\nThe Difference columns for US Stocks and Nom. Bonds (cells B10 and D10) are noticeably more green.\nAlthough there is more to do with Int’l Stocks and TIPS, this exchange would help get the portfolio closer to alignment with its new target. If it hadn’t or if had I spotted a better sequence of transactions, I could quickly delete the two mock transactions and try something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMocking out possible transactions all at once ahead of time has made rebalancing a lot easier for me. It is much quicker in a spreadsheet than other tools I have tried."
