For Alice and Bob’s example portfolio in this post, I have entered:\n\nAccount names and types.\nFund symbols and the asset class(es) they represent.\nHoldings/transactions: a fund and the number of shares owned per account (e.g., Roth IRA, 936 shares of VTI2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransactions\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this data filled in, the next tab called Account Holdings automatically generates a report.\nThe spreadsheet uses the GOOGLEFINANCE function to dynamically recalculate current values as share prices change over time:\n\n\n\nAccount Holdings\n\n\nI use this report to cross-check against my online statements.

    "text": "Rebalance Matrix\nWith the target asset allocation in place, the next tab called Rebalance Matrix generates a report.\n\n\n\nRebalance Matrix\n\n\nThis report places accounts vertically on the left and asset classes horizontally across the top.\nEach cell in the inner matrix pairs a fund with account and asset class.\nIn cell B12, $257,250 of VTI (a US stock fund) is owned in the Roth IRA (Alice) account and is in the US Stocks asset class. It is the only fund owned in that account.\nIn cell C14, $310,500 of VXUS (an international stock fund) is owned in the Roth IRA (Bob) account and is in the Int’l Stocks asset class. Similarly, it is the only fund owned in its account.\nDifferent funds in the same asset class are “stacked” vertically. Cells B20-B23 show 65% of VT and 100% of VTI allocated to US Stocks within the Brokerage (Joint) account. 35% of VT, its non-US allocation, is shown in cell C20 under the Int’l Stocks asset class. In total, the Brokerage (Joint) account owns VT, VTI, SCHP and VMFXX.\nLooking back toward the top in rows 4-10, Target (% and $) and Actual show target and actual asset class allocations in percent and dollars, summed by column, representing the allocations summed across all accounts.\nIf target and actual deviate too far, the Difference cells will automatically become more red, indicating that money should ideally start moving from well-performing asset classes to relatively underperforming ones (“sell high, buy low!”).\nAlice and Bob probably do not need to rebalance in this example. They are within 1 percentage point of their desired asset allocation in every asset class (row 7). The largest deviation is shown in cell D7 and D10 but is small compared to their portfolio.\n\nA Different Scenario\nIf I were Alice and Bob, I would open the spreadsheet every few months to add new transactions and check for growing deviations in the Rebalance Matrix. Close monitoring would not be required.\nBut what if Alice and Bob want to experiment with raising their stock allocation to 75% (from 65%)? In the Asset Allocation sheet:\n\n\n\nChanging the stock allocation to 75%\n\n\nThe Rebalance Matrix sheet automatically regenerates5:\n\n\n\nRebalance Matrix with 75% target stock allocation\n\n\nThe story here is much more, er, red.\nAs expected, Alice and Bob would need to start moving money out of Nom. Bonds and TIPS and into US Stocks and Int’l Stocks.\nFor example, US stocks are now 5.24 percentage points (cell B7) from target. $114,579 (cell B10) needs to flow from other asset classes into US Stocks to rebalance exactly.\nRebalancing can be a complicated exercise involving personalized circumstances and tax considerations. The spreadsheet lets me quickly experiment with several ideas before executing any trades.\nFor this example, I will show one possible transaction in what might need to be multiple to fully complete the rebalance:\n\n\n\nA trial rebalance in the Transactions sheet\n\n\nThese rows represent an exchange Alice could consider to rebalance from Nom. Bonds and into US Stocks in her Example Corp 401(k):\n\nA sale (negative number) of 11,068.335 shares of FXNAX, a fund in the Nom. Bonds category that is currently overweight by $133,486 (cell D10).\nUsing the sale proceeds, a purchase (positive number) of $115,000 of FSKAX, a US stock fund. $115,000 is a rounded off version of the $114,579 inflow (cell B10) needed to reach the target allocation of US Stocks.\n\nI used =115000 / GOOGLEFINANCE(\"SYMBOL\") to get the rough number of shares for $115,000 of each fund at today’s prices. For the sale, I used -115000, a negative number.\nIf Alice actually executed this transaction, she would later change the values to the exact share counts when the trade settled.\nAdding these two transactions causes the Rebalance Matrix to automatically regenerate:\n\n\n\nRebalance Matrix after the exchange\n\n\nIn cells B16-D17, the exchange is shown as $115,000 of newly purchased FSKAX (the stock fund) while FXNAX (the bond fund) shows a balance reduced by $115,000 compared to the prior screenshot.\nTotal balances have not changed because money is only moving from the FXNAX fund to FSKAX, netting to zero in total.\nThe Difference columns for US Stocks and Nom. Bonds (cells B10 and D10) are noticeably more green.\nAlthough there is more to do with Int’l Stocks and TIPS, this exchange would help get the portfolio closer to alignment with its new target. If it hadn’t or if had I spotted a better sequence of transactions, I could quickly delete the two mock transactions and try something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMocking out possible transactions all at once ahead of time has made rebalancing a lot easier for me. It is much quicker in a spreadsheet than other tools I have tried."

Can it really be true?\nConsider that if I have $850 in some account and want my balance to be $1,000 in a year, I need a 17.65% interest rate:\n\\[\n\\begin{flalign}\nA &= P(1 + r) \\\\\n1000 &= 850(1 + r) \\\\\nr &= \\frac{1000}{850} - 1 \\\\\n  &= 0.1765 \\\\\n  &= 17.65\\%\n\\end{flalign}\n\\]\nIt takes a full year at 17.65% interest to generate $150 from $850.\nIntuitively the ESPP equivalent rate must be higher than an account paying 17.65% interest.\nWith ESPP, I contributed $71 twice per month for 6 months (totaling approximately $850).\nThe first $71 was escrowed for about 6 months, the next $71 for 5.5 months, etc. until the final contribution for only a few days or weeks. On average, one of my dollars was tied up for approximately 3 months (half of the purchase period).\nSo yes, $850 that turns into $1,000 in 3 months works out to an exceptionally high 91.57% annualized rate:\n\\[\n\\begin{flalign}\nr &= \\biggl(\\frac{A}{P}\\biggl)^t - 1 \\\\\n  &= \\biggl(\\frac{1}{1 - discount}\\biggl)^t - 1 \\\\\n  &= \\biggl(\\frac{1}{0.85}\\biggl)^4 - 1\\\\\n  &= 0.9157 \\\\\n  &= 91.57\\%\n\\end{flalign}\n\\]\n\\(t=4\\) because there are 4 3-month quarters in a year.\nTo calculate ESPP profit for your own plan, try the tool on the right.\nIn summary, the ESPP “sticker” discount rate of 5–15% is not the full story!"

    "text": "Caveats\nESPP administration and tax law have caveats that change the math in some scenarios. However, I have never seen these issues alone make a plan undesirable.\nFor instance, volatility in the stock price between the purchase date and when the stock can later be sold means the profit will inevitably be a little higher or lower than the calculators show. I limit the impact of this volatility by having a recurring reminder to sell as quickly as possible.\nCommissions and fees reduce the effective interest rate slightly.\nSome plans allow purchasing partial shares. Others may only allow whole shares; in that case, the “change” will be refunded on a future paycheck.\nQualified (tax efficient) plans under §423 are limited to $25,000 of stock per year2. With a 15% discount, the maximum contribution works out to be $21,250.\nPlans with a lookback feature calculate the maximum number of shares per purchase period from the price at the start of the offering period. If the stock falls in value during this offering period, the maximum number of shares may be worth less than the maximum dollar contribution in later purchase periods. Money that cannot be used to purchase shares will be refunded, but it will also lower the effective interest rate.\nMost plans allow employees to withdraw during a purchase period and have the accrued money refunded on a future paycheck. There may be significant delay between withdrawing from the plan and receiving the money.\nSome people consider strategically withdrawing based on movement in the stock price. I have yet to see a case where the return on hassle is compelling. ESPP is best left as a mechanical process to generate extra income every purchase period.\nIf an employee is terminated (voluntarily or involuntarily), money contributed during a purchase period will be refunded on their final paycheck or shortly after."
